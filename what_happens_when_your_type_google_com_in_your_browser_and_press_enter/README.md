A detailed technical diagram illustrating the complete request flow:
- DNS resolution process
- TCP/IP connection establishment on port 443
- Encrypted data transmission
- Firewall traversal
- Load balancer distribution
- Web server processing
- Application server page generation
- Database queries and responses

## üîç Key Technical Areas Explored

### Network Infrastructure
- **DNS Resolution**: How domain names convert to IP addresses through the hierarchical DNS system
- **TCP/IP Protocol**: The three-way handshake and packet transmission that forms the backbone of internet communication
- **Firewall Security**: How packets are filtered and security is maintained at various network layers

### Security & Encryption
- **HTTPS/SSL/TLS**: Certificate validation, handshake process, and encryption methods
- **Public Key Infrastructure**: How trusted connections are established between client and server

### Server Architecture
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution algorithms and high-availability techniques
- **Web Server Processing**: Static content delivery and request handling
- **Application Servers**: Dynamic content generation and business logic implementation
- **Database Interactions**: Data retrieval, query optimization, and caching strategies

### Browser Operations
- **HTML/CSS Rendering**: DOM construction and the critical rendering path
- **JavaScript Execution**: How scripts modify the page and enable interactivity
- **Resource Management**: How browsers prioritize and load various page components

## üß† Why This Matters

Understanding this end-to-end process is fundamental for:
- Software engineers designing web applications
- DevOps engineers managing infrastructure
- Security professionals implementing protective measures
- Anyone seeking to comprehend how the modern web functions
